# EMI-Calculator-Introduction to Programming Project

## 📌Overview

This is a Project I made using Python. It is an EMI Calculator that has a GUI (Graphical User Interface). I created this to help calculate monthly loan payments. It uses a simple window where you can type numbers and get the answer.

## 📌Features

* Simple Calculation: It calculates the monthly payment using the standard EMI formula.
* Easy to use: I added labels and text boxes so it is easy to understand.
* Error Checking: If you accidentally type letters instead of numbers, it shows a pop-up message so the program doesn't crash.
* Works Offline: You don't need internet to use it because it uses standard Python libraries.

## 📌Technologies/Tools Used

* Language: Python (It is beginner-friendly)
* Library: Tkinter (It comes with Python)
* Logic: Basic Math

## 📌Steps to Run The Project

Download: Save the emi_calculator.py file in a folder.
Run it: Open your command prompt (cmd) or terminal, go to the folder, and type:
python emi_calculator.py


## 📌Instructions for Testing

You can try these steps to verify if the project is working correctly:

1. Normal Calculation Test:
* Run the code.
* In Loan Amount, type "10000".
* In Interest Rate, type "5".
* In Years, type "1".
* Click the Calculate button.
* Result: You should see the monthly EMI amount at the bottom.
