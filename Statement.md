## 📌Program Statement
Financial planning is very important for people seeking loans for homes, cars, or personal uses. 
Calculating the EMI manually involves complex mathematical formulae, which are not only cumbersome but also prone to human error. 
The average user often finds it difficult to quickly arrive at an estimate of their monthly financial obligations based on varying interest rates and tenures-ultimately, bad financial decisions.

## 📌Scope Of The Project
The scope of this project is to develop a lightweight, desktop-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) application using the Python programming language. The application specifically focuses on:
* Providing a user-friendly interface for financial data entry.
* Automating the mathematical computation of monthly loan payments.
* Ensuring data validation to prevent calculation errors from incorrect inputs.

## 📌Target Users
This application is designed for:

* Prospective Borrowers: These are those who intend to obtain loans and thus have to budget their monthly expenses.
* Bank Employees/Agents: Those professionals who require a tool to offer quick estimates to clients.
* Students: Those studying financial mathematics and the structure of loans.

## 📌High-Level Features
Based on the implemented functional requirements, the system includes the following features:
* Input Management: Dedicated fields for User Input regarding Loan Amount (Principal), Interest Rate (%), and Tenure (Years).
* Automated Calculation Engine: accurate implementation of the standard EMI formula

* Error Handling: Robust validation to detect non-numeric inputs and alert the user via pop-up error messages.
* Result Visualization: Clear, rounded numerical display of the calculated monthly EMI.
